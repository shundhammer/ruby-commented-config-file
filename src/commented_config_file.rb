# Utility class to read and write config files that might contain comments.
# This class tries to preserve any existing comments and keep them together
# with the content line immediately following them.
#
# This class supports the notion of a header comment block, a footer comment
# block, a comment block preceding any content line and a line comment on the
# content line itself.
#
# A comment preceding a content line is stored together with the content line,
# so moving around entries in the file will keep the comment with the content
# line it belongs to.
#
# The default comment marker is '#' like in most Linux config files, but it
# can be set with setCommentMarker().
#
# Example (line numbers added for easier reference):
#
#   001    # Header comment 1
#   002    # Header comment 2
#   003    # Header comment 3
#   004
#   005
#   006    # Header comment 4
#   007    # Header comment 5
#   008
#   009    # Content line 1 comment 1
#   010    # Content line 1 comment 2
#   011    content line 1
#   012    content line 2
#   013
#   014    content line 3
#   015
#   016    content line 4
#   017    content line 5 # Line comment 5
#   018    # Content line 6 comment 1
#   019
#   020    content line 6 # Line comment 6
#   021    content line 7
#   022
#   023    # Footer comment 1
#   024    # Footer comment 2
#   025
#   026    # Footer comment 3
#
#
# Empty lines or lines that have only whitespace belong to the next comment
# block: The footer comment consists of lines 022..026.
#
# The only exception is the header comment that stretches from the start of
# the file to the last empty line preceding a content line. This is what
# separates the header comment from the comment that belongs to the first
# content line. In this example, the header comment consists of lines
# 001..008.
#
# Content line 1 in line 011 has comments 009..010.
# Content line 2 in line 012 has no comment.
# Content line 3 in line 014 has comment 013 (an empty line).
# Content line 5 in line 017 has a line comment "# Line comment 5".
# Content line 6 in line 020 has comments 018..019 and a line comment.
#
# Applications using this class can largely just ignore all the comment stuff;
# the class will handle the comments automagically.
